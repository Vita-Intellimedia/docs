## Documentation Philosophy

Great documentation is essential for user success and reduces support burden. Follow these principles to create documentation that serves both technical and non-technical audiences effectively.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Write Just Enough Documentation" icon="balance-scale" defaultOpen>
    - Find the balance between lack of and excessive documentation
    - Don't repeat information across multiple documents
    - Focus on what users need to succeed, not everything that's possible
    
    <Tip>
      If you find yourself repeating content, consider using [reusable snippets](/essentials/reusable-snippets) instead.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Consider Your Audience" icon="users">
    - **Keep it simple**: Write for clarity and ease of understanding
    - **Provide navigation**: Include a clear table of contents
    - **Be concise**: Avoid long blocks of text—no one likes reading more than necessary
    - **Use visual content**: Include tables, graphs, charts, and diagrams
    - **Define technical terms**: Link to glossaries or provide clear definitions
    
    <Warning>
      Our audience includes non-technical users. Always provide context and avoid jargon.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Use Cross-Links" icon="link">
    - Link to related documentation, product pages, and user guides
    - Help users build complete understanding through intuitive navigation
    - Create a seamless documentation experience
    
    ```mdx
    // Example: Linking to related content
    For more details, see [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) 
    or [Local Development Setup](/getting-started/development).
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Leverage Glossaries" icon="book-bookmark">
    - Provide clear explanations for each technical term
    - Define specific meanings within the context of your project
    - **Critical for non-technical audiences** who need to understand domain-specific terminology
    
    <Note>
      Consider creating a dedicated glossary page for frequently used terms.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Keep Documentation Up to Date" icon="arrows-rotate">
    - Update documentation when code changes during development
    - Out-of-date docs create confusion and increase support requests
    - Ensure systematic updates through CI/CD processes
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Document changes in MRs">
        Include documentation updates in every merge request that affects user-facing features
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review during code review">
        Verify documentation accuracy as part of the code review process
      </Step>
      <Step title="Automated publishing">
        CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys approved changes
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Prioritize Teamwork" icon="people-group">
    - Collaborate with team members and subject matter experts
    - Ensure complete, cohesive understanding of software functionality
    - Get feedback and technical verification for accuracy
    
    <Card title="Documentation Review Process" icon="clipboard-check">
      Treat documentation reviews similarly to code reviews—multiple eyes ensure quality and accuracy.
    </Card>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="7. Pay Attention to Details" icon="magnifying-glass">
    - Proofread documentation multiple times
    - Have multiple team members review for clarity and accuracy
    - Follow a similar approval process to merge requests
    - Check for consistent formatting and tone
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="8. Be Strategic with Screenshots & Multimedia" icon="camera">
    While visual media enhances user experience, it requires careful consideration:
    
    **Challenges:**
    - Difficult to update and maintain
    - Quickly becomes outdated with UI changes
    - Requires additional tooling and processes
    
    **Guidelines:**
    - Reserve for features that are near-final and stable
    - Document the process for creating and updating media
    - Establish a tech stack that makes updates streamlined
    
    <Warning>
      Only add screenshots for features unlikely to change significantly. Text descriptions are easier to maintain.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="9. Pair Documentation with Source Code" icon="code-merge">
    - Keep documentation close to the code it describes
    - Makes it easier to update both simultaneously
    - Reduces the chance of documentation drift
    
    <Info>
      Our documentation lives in the same GitLab organization as our source code, making it easy to link changes.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="10. Documentation Control" icon="list-check">
    Maintain proper governance over documentation:
    - Version control through Git
    - Clear procedures for updates and approvals
    - Appropriate access controls
    - Systematic organization and navigation structure
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="11. Consider a Technical Writer Role" icon="pen-fancy">
    As the company grows, consider:
    - Assigning or hiring a dedicated technical writer
    - Enforcing documentation standards consistently
    - Monitoring analytics (What pages do users visit most?)
    - Identifying documentation gaps
    - Improving content based on user behavior
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="12. Leverage Document Management System" icon="sparkles">
