# Contributing Guidelines

A set of guidelines to follow when creating or editing user documentation.

## How to write great documentation

1. Write just enough documentation:
    Find a balance between lack of and excessive documentation.
    Don't repeat information in multiple documents.
2. Consider your audience:
    Keep your documentation simple and easy to read.
    Include table of contents and ensure it is up to date.
    Avoid long text ( No one likes reading more than they have to ).
    Use visual content including, tables, graphs, and charts.
    Use simple language when possible and link to definitions of technical terms.
3. Use cross-links:
    Link to additional documentation including product pages and user guides.
    Helps user to get a complete understanding of the documentation in an intuitive seamless way.
4. Leverage glossaries:
    Provide a clear explanation of each term and its specific meaning in the project. ( Very important for our non-technical audience).
5. Keep documentation up to date:
    Be sure to update the information based on any changes that may have occurred during development. ( Out of date documentation means more time by developers addressing client questions and concerns that cab be avoided by clear and up to date documentation ).
    Ensure systematic process of updating documentation ( CI/CD process for every MR ).
6. Prioritize teamwork:
    Collaborate with team members and subject matter experts to ensure a complete, cohesive understanding of the relevant functionality of the software.
    Get feedback and technically verify the accuracy of information contained within the documentation.
7. Pay attention to the details:
    Proofread documentation multiple times with multiple team members to unsure the form is clear, organized and accurate. ( Follow a similar procedure to MR's )
8. Avoid screenshots and multimedia:
    These forms of media are great for the end user and provide a clearer explanation of our software but they are hard to update and maintain.
    Screenshots and multimedia should be reserved for features that are as close to finalized as can be reasonably expected.
    A process and tech stack needs to be well documented so team members who need to update multimedia can do so in a streamlined familiar way.
9. Pair documentation alongside source code:
    This will make it easier to keep both documentation and source code updated.
10. Documentation control:
    Ensure proper numbering, versioning, procedures and access to documentation.
11. Consider a technical writer role/responsibility:
    As the company grows it may be beneficial to assign/hire a team member to ensure enforcement of documentation standards.
    Outline the specific responsibilities such as monitoring analytics ( What pages do clients frequently use? ).
12. Leverage document management system:
    We have elected to use [Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com/)
    Mintlify offers us a simple and easy to use web interface to manage our documentation. ( Freeing up our developers to focus on improving our product )
    Ai native platform built for developers allows us to quickly and efficiently manage and update our documentation.
    Simplifies the design and leverages .mdx to make it easier for our team to just write documentation.
    Integrates well with our agile development process making it easy to ensure up to date documentation.
    [Mintlify Agent](https://www.mintlify.com/blog/agents-launch) to update docs based on context from MCP servers and our own MR's.
