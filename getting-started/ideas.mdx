Here are some ideas and questions for the future of the docs site.

## UI Component Package

Should we export UI elements as a package in a private registry? This would help keep design consistent across docs as each component will be updated whenever VitaOne is updated.

For example, we could have a button component that is imported from `@vita/ui` and used in MDX files. This approach would:

- Show users exactly which button component we're referencing
- Ensure components stay up-to-date as we change things in VitaOne
- Maintain visual and behavioral consistency across all documentation

<Tip>
  A private package registry would create a single source of truth for UI components, reducing maintenance overhead and improving documentation accuracy.

## Mirroring VitaOne's Repo onto GitHub

Should we mirror VitaOne's main repository onto GitHub? This would enable us to leverage Mintlify's AI context features to help generate and automatically update documentation based on code changes.

### Benefits of Mirroring:

- **AI-Powered Documentation** - Mintlify can analyze code changes and suggest documentation updates
- **Automated Content Generation** - Reduce manual effort in keeping docs synchronized with code
- **Better Context** - AI tools have access to complete codebase for more accurate documentation
- **Dual-Source Flexibility** - Maintain GitLab as source of truth while leveraging GitHub ecosystem benefits

<Warning>
  This approach requires maintaining synchronization between GitLab and GitHub repositories to prevent divergence.
</Warning>

## Repository Location Strategy

Should the docs repository live in the same GitLab group as VitaOne's code, or in a separate GitHub repository?

### Option 1: Unified GitLab Location

**Pros:**
- Simpler organizational structure
- Combined commits for related code and documentation changes
- Single source of truth in one location

**Cons:**
- Would require mirroring to GitHub for Mintlify's AI features
- Additional maintenance overhead for synchronization

### Option 2: Separate GitHub Repository

**Pros:**
- Direct integration with Mintlify's AI and publishing features
- Independent deployment and update cycles
- Simplified GitHub mirror setup

**Cons:**
- Separate repository management
- Coordination needed between code and documentation updates

<Tip>
  Consider the primary workflow: if documentation updates often coincide with code releases, a unified location may be preferable. If docs are updated independently, a separate repo provides more flexibility.
