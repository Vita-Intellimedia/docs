## Recommendation

<Check>
  **Our Choice: Mintlify**
</Check>

Mintlify offers the most balanced solution for our authoring and docs-repo workflows. Here's why:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Strengths" icon="circle-check">
    - **GitLab Integration**: Official support via access tokens and webhooks
    - **Merge Request Previews**: Automatic preview builds for every MR
    - **AI-Powered Features**: Chat assistant, writing agent, and styling checks
    - **Developer-Friendly**: Content lives in Git as portable MDX files
    - **Modern Experience**: Clean UI with excellent DX
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="⚠️ Considerations" icon="circle-exclamation">
    - **Built with GitHub in Mind**: Some advanced features require GitHub integration and currently most documentation focuses on GitHub
    - **Code-Aware AI Limitations**: Advanced features (using production codebase as context, opening change requests) require the GitHub App
    - **Migration Path**: To unlock full code-aware AI capabilities, we'd need to migrate or mirror application repositories to GitHub
    - **Current State**: With GitLab, we still get the hosted editor, site, and AI assistance over docs content
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Even without GitHub integration, Mintlify provides excellent value through its GitLab support, hosted infrastructure, and AI-assisted writing capabilities.
